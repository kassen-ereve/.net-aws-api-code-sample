This repository demonstrates a simple AWS Lambda-based API for handling CRUD operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) on an Employee entity. The project is divided into four separate Lambda functions, each dedicated to a specific operation. It utilizes AWS API Gateway for routing and DynamoDB as the database. Swagger UI is integrated to allow viewers to easily test the endpoints. Additionally, xUnit and Moq are used for unit testing to ensure functionality and test coverage. This project serves as a basic showcase of my C# development style, AWS Lambda architecture, unit testing practices, and use of cloud technologies.
